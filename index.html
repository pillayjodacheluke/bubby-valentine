        <p>
          To My Bubby, ❤️
There are moments in life that feel like magic, and every moment I spend with you is exactly that. Your smile, your laugh, the way you light up a room without even trying, it makes my world feel brighter, softer, and full of hope. I never knew that someone could make ordinary days feel extraordinary, but you do, effortlessly.
This Valentine’s Day, I don’t just want to give you a card or flowers, I want to give you my heart in words, to tell you how much you mean to me, how deeply I care for you, and how grateful I am for every little thing you do that makes me fall for you all over again.
Being with you is a gift I never take for granted, and having you in my life makes everything more beautiful. It would be my greatest honor, my deepest joy, for you to be my Valentine. 💖<br>
